# wireInterface
Technology specific interface definition for Ethernet PHY interfaces according to IEEE 802.3

The first implementations of the wireInterface have been made within framework of the 5th ONF PoC during November 2018.

Consolidated UML and YANG models, which were based on ONF Core IM 1.2 and comprising airInterface, wireInterface, pureEthernetStructure and EthernetContainer, were generated for that purpose.

The attached 181009-MW-PHY-IM.zip contains the Papyrus project export of the UML model used during the 5th ONF PoC.

181009 WireInterface PoC5.docx (Gendoc-Export) and 181009 WireInterfaceCD.PNG (Class-Diagram) are describing the WireInterface_Pac as applied in the 5th ONF PoC.

MW-ETH-PHY_10_Oct2018_19Hr40Mins.zip contains the YANG files comprising airInterface, wireInterface, pureEthernetStructure and EthernetContainer as they have been applied during the 5th ONF PoC.
